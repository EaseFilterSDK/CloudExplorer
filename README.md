Cloud Storage Gateway
To connect and manage the cloud storage, we implement a cloud provider class for different cloud providers with below interface, we have implemented all these functionalities for Amazon S3 and Azure Storage with the .NET SDK, you can add more cloud provider code to here.

The Cloud storage tiering was implemented with tiered storage file system filter driver. A file system filter driver intercepts requests targeted at a file system or another file system filter driver. By intercepting the request before it reaches its intended target, the filter driver can extend or replace functionality provided by the original target of the request.

CloudTier Cloud Storage Connect is a data storage technique which automatically moves data between high-cost local disk and low-cost remote cloud storage. CloudTier Cloud Storage Connect can help simplify the migration process by providing the transparent file access from the remote storage. Using the cloud as a storage tier, data can first be moved to a ‘warm’ archive tier of higher-performance disk.

Integrate your exiting on-premises applications with remote cloud storage transparently                     
With CloudTier Cloud Storage Connect service can connect an on-premise software appliance with cloud-based storage to integrate your existing on-premises applications with the remote cloud storage infrastructure in a seamless, secure, and transparent fashion.There are no interruption to migrate your on-premise files to the remote cloud storage, don't need to change your existing applications and infrastructure.
